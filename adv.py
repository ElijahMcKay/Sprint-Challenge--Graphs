"""
 You are provided with a pre-generated graph consisting of 500 rooms. You are responsible for filling `traversal_path` with directions that, when walked in order, will visit every room on the map at least once.

* World generation code. Do not modify this!
* An incomplete list of directions. Your task is to fill this with valid traversal directions.
* Test code. Run the tests by typing `python3 adv.py` in your terminal.
* REPL code. You can uncomment this and run `python3 adv.py` to walk around the map.


You may find the commands `player.current_room.id`, `player.current_room.get_exits()` and `player.travel(direction)` useful.

To solve this path, you'll want to construct your own traversal graph. You start in room `0`, which contains exits `['n', 's', 'w', 'e']`. Your starting graph should look something like this:

```
{
  0: {'n': '?', 's': '?', 'w': '?', 'e': '?'}
}
```
#1 Depth first traversal will give every possible room

#2 If player.current_room.get_exits() is not none, for item
